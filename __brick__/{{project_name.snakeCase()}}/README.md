## Customizing Splash Screen

## Android
To customize the size of the splash screen image in your Android project, follow these steps:

**Locate the `launch_background.xml` files:**
```
- android/app/src/main/res/drawable/launch_background.xml
- android/app/src/main/res/drawable-v21/launch_background.xml
```
For more information and recommendations on splash screen sizes, refer to the [Android Developer documentation on splash screens](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/views/launch/splash-screen#elements).
